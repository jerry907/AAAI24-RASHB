abstract = {We study the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem for sets of points or balls in high
dimensions. Using techniques of second-order cone programming and "core-sets", we
have developed (1 + ε)-approximation algorithms that perform well in practice, especially
for very high dimensions, in addition to having provable guarantees. We prove the
existence of core-sets of size O(1/ε), improving the previous bound of O(1/ε2), and
we study empirically how the core-set size grows with dimension. We show that our
algorithm, which is simple to implement, results in fast computation of nearly optimal
solutions for point sets in much higher dimension than previously computable using
exact techniques.},

abstract = {Given ${cal A} := {a^1,dots,a^m} subset mathbb{R}^n$ and $epsilon > 0$, we
propose and analyze two algorithms for the problem of computing a $(1 + epsilon)$-approximation
to the radius of the minimum enclosing ball of ${cal A}$. The first algorithm is
closely related to the Frank-Wolfe algorithm with a proper initialization applied
to the dual formulation of the minimum enclosing ball problem. We establish that this
algorithm converges in $O(1/epsilon)$ iterations with an overall complexity bound
of $O(mn/epsilon)$ arithmetic operations. In addition, the algorithm returns a “core
set” of size $O(1/epsilon)$, which is independent of both $m$ and $n$. The latter
algorithm is obtained by incorporating “away” steps into the former one at each iteration
and achieves the same asymptotic complexity bound as the first one. While the asymptotic
bound on the size of the core set returned by the second algorithm also remains the
same as the first one, the latter algorithm has the potential to compute even smaller
core sets in practice, since, in contrast to the former one, it allows “dropping”
points from the working core set at each iteration. Our analysis reveals that the
leading terms in the asymptotic complexity analysis are reasonably small. In contrast
to the first algorithm, we also establish that the second algorithm asymptotically
exhibits linear convergence, which provides further insight into our computational
results, indicating that the latter algorithm indeed terminates faster with smaller
core sets in comparison with the first one. We also discuss how our algorithms can
be extended to compute an approximation to the minimum enclosing ball of more general
input sets without sacrificing the iteration complexity and the bound on the core
set size. In particular, we establish the existence of a core set of size $O(1/epsilon)$
for a much wider class of input sets. We adopt the real number model of computation
in our analysis.},

 abstract = {In the classical linear programming problem the behaviour of continuous, nonnegative variables subject to a system of linear inequalities is investigated. One possible generalization of this problem is to relax the continuity condition the variables. This paper presents a simple numerical algorithm for the solution of programming problems in which some or all of the variables can take only discrete values. The algorithm requires no special techniques beyond these used in ordinary linear programming, and lends itself to automatic computing. Its use is illustrated on two numerical examples.},

abstract = {Although the multiplicative congruential method for generating pseudo-random numbers
is widely used and has passed a number of tests of randomness [1, 2], attempts have
been made to find an additive congruential method since it could be expected to be
faster. Tests on a Fibonacci sequence [1] have shown it to be unsatisfactory. The
sequence xi+1 = (2a + 1) xi + c (mod 235) (1) has been tested on the IBM 704. In appendix
I it is shown that the sequence generates the full period of 235 numbers for a ≧ 2
and c odd. Similar results obtain for decimal machines. Since multiplication by a
power of the base can be accomplished by shifting, which is comparable in speed to
addition, this scheme requires essentially three additions. It takes 14 machine cycles
on the IBM 704, compared to 28 for the multiplicative method, so that the saving is
168 μs/random number. The scheme has the further advantage that it does not destroy
the multiplier-quotient register.Some tests have been made on the randomness of this
sequence for a = 7 and c = 1, and a summary of the results is given in appendix II,
where now the random numbers are considered to lie in the interval (0, 1).The serial
correlation coefficient between one member of this sequence and the next is shown
by Coveyou [3] to be approximately 0.8 per cent. By taking a = 9 this correlation
coefficient can be reduced to approximately 0.2 per cent without increasing the time.
Taking a = 21 would make this correlation very small but would require one more machine
cycle on the IBM 704. Another way to reduce the correlation is to choose c such that
the numerator in Coveyou's expression for the correlation coefficient is zero. This
cannot be done exactly since it requires that c = (.5 ± √3/6)2P where P is the number
of binary digits (excluding sign) in a machine word. However, a machine representation
close to either of these numbers should be satisfactory. Some correlations with c
= (.788+)235 and a = 7 were obtained and did not differ significantly from those given
for c = 1 in the first section of appendix II.The author wishes to thank R. R. Coveyou
for communicating his results in advance of publication and Elizabeth Wetherell for
carrying out the calculations.},

abstract = {Detecting outliers in a large set of data objects is a major data mining task aiming
at finding different mechanisms responsible for different groups of objects in a data
set. All existing approaches, however, are based on an assessment of distances (sometimes
indirectly by assuming certain distributions) in the full-dimensional Euclidean data
space. In high-dimensional data, these approaches are bound to deteriorate due to
the notorious "curse of dimensionality". In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named ABOD (Angle-Based Outlier Detection) and some variants assessing the variance
in the angles between the difference vectors of a point to the other points. This
way, the effects of the "curse of dimensionality" are alleviated compared to purely
distance-based approaches. A main advantage of our new approach is that our method
does not rely on any parameter selection influencing the quality of the achieved ranking.
In a thorough experimental evaluation, we compare ABOD to the well-established distance-based
method LOF for various artificial and a real world data set and show ABOD to perform
especially well on high-dimensional data.},

abstract = {Suppose you are given some dataset drawn from an underlying probability distribution
P and you want to estimate a "simple" subset S of input space such that the probability
that a test point drawn from P lies outside of S equals some a priori specified ν
between 0 and 1.We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate
a function f which is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional
form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of
the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector
in an associated feature space. We provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical
performance of our algorithm.The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector
algorithm to the case of unlabelled data.},
